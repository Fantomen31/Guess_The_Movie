In your Repository section, select the Repository you wish to deploy.
In the top horizontal Menu, locate and click the Settings link.
Inside the Setting page, around halfway down locate the GitHub Pages Section.
Under Source, select the None tab and change it to Main and click Save.
Finally once the page resets scroll back down to the GitHub Pages Section to see the following message "Your site is ready to be published at (Link to the GitHub Page Web Address)". It can take time for the link to open your project initially, so please don't be worried if it down not load immediately.

Forking the Github Repository

You can fork a GitHub Repository to make a copy of the original repository to view or make changes without it affecting the original repository.

Find the GitHub repository.
At the top of the page to the right, under your account, click the Fork button.
You will now have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

Making a Local Clone

Click the Code button
Copy the link shown.
In Gitpod, change the directory to the location you would like the cloned directory to be located.
Type git clone, and paste the link you copied in step 3.

### As we can see there was no viewport code. After I added the initial viewport structure I got the following score.

### And then I added the media queries as well as changed the font size and got the following score.

- HTML 
   - No bugs, only img src errors in HTML code, but using them in a function in JS instead to make the game functionable.
- CSS
   - No bugs, and no errors.
- JS
   - No bugs. But two "unused variables" for function 'guess' & 'nextRound'. 

## Known-issues

- These are actually used but as events in the HTML code. If I had the time I'd like to change them both to EventListeners in the JS file instead. Validated JS, had two "unused variables", 'guess'(line 68 in script.js) and 'nextRound', (line 94 in script.js), are being called within html on (line 22, 23 & 26). 
Same with score.js file, itâ€™s part of an onlick. And if I had the time I'd like to change it to event listeners.
